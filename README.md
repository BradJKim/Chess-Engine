# Chess-Evaluation-Model

Chess game with opponent (black) as Machine learning model that evaluates board and plays optimal move.
This project uses deep learning to predict the evaluation of a given chess position, in addition to React.js and Django for UI and Backend Requests. 
The model is trained on a dataset of games found on Kaggle.
Due to resource restrictions during training, model is still limited and does not perfectly replicate training-data to its fullest potential.
